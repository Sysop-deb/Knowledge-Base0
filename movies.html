###I love movies where things are not what they seem at first.
###Where they're exploring a new medium, a new quirk, a new and special idea.
###Or just exploring something in a different manner.
###Once in a while I don't mind a captivating feel-good one. Anything that'll make me enjoy the gorgeous world of cinematography.
